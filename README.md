# Salesman-Problem
In this project, we implement a simulated annealing algorithm to find a solution for the travel salesman problem, that consists to find the shortest path between a select number of points.  We also use parallel programming to optimize the execution of this program.


The main objective of this project was to implement a parallel solution to the annealing algorithm and see if there is a major difference between parallel and non-parallel solutions to this problem. 

To run this program you should have installed Open Mp, as well as chrono to run the tests. Then if you have it you can run the program with the command "make executable" and "make test" to run the tests. 

This project was made by  @jrodriguezcay, @RonaldVelasco and me, @acuervov.
